And art made tongue-tied by autority,
And captive good attending captain ill:
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And gilded honour shamefully misplac’d,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac’d,
And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
As to behold desert a beggar born,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, -
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
