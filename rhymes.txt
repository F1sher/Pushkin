And gilded honour shamefully misplac’d,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac’d,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And captive good attending captain ill:
As to behold desert a beggar born,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, -
And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,
And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,
And art made tongue-tied by autority,
